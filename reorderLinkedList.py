# Below is the **exact** code you asked for, followed by a **line-by-line** breakdown in super simple terms—like you're explaining it to someone who's never coded before. I'll also include a **visual** to help you picture what's going on. Let's dive in!

# ## **The Code**

# ```python
# class Solution:
#     def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
#         # 1) Find the middle of the list
#         slow, fast = head, head.next
#         while fast and fast.next:
#             slow = slow.next
#             fast = fast.next.next

#         # 2) Reverse the second half of the list
#         second = slow.next
#         prev = slow.next = None
#         while second:
#             tmp = second.next
#             second.next = prev
#             prev = second
#             second = tmp

#         # 3) Merge the two halves
#         first, second = head, prev
#         while second:
#             tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
#             first.next = second
#             second.next = tmp1
#             first, second = tmp1, tmp2
# ```

# # **Line-by-Line Explanation (Like You're 5)**

# Let's break this down so even someone brand new (or a "dumbass," as you put it!) can understand. I'll number each part to match the code.

# ---

# ## **1) `class Solution:`**

# - We're creating a **blueprint** or a **folder** called `Solution`.
# - Think of this as a container that holds our function(s).

# ---

# ## **2) `def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:`**

# - Inside that `Solution` folder, we have a **function** named `reorderList`.
# - It takes one argument, `head`, which is the first node in a linked list.
# - The function doesn't return anything (`-> None`); it modifies the list in place.

# **What are we trying to do?**
# - We want to **reorder** the linked list so that the nodes follow a specific pattern:
#   - First node → Last node → Second node → Second Last node → Third node → ...
# - Example:
#   - Original: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
#   - Reordered: 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3

# ---

# ## **3) `slow, fast = head, head.next`**

# - We create two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
# - **`slow`** starts at the first node (`head`).
# - **`fast`** starts at the second node (`head.next`).

# **Why two pointers?**
# - We're going to use the classic "fast and slow pointer" trick to find the **middle** of the list.

# ---

# ## **4) `while fast and fast.next:`**

# - This is a loop that keeps going **as long as**:
#   1. `fast` is not `None` (meaning `fast` hasn't fallen off the list), and
#   2. `fast.next` is also not `None`.

# **Why check both?**
# - Because `fast` will move **two steps** at a time. We need to make sure it's safe to move those two steps.

# ---

# ## **5) `slow = slow.next`**
# - Inside the loop, **move** `slow` **1 step** forward.

# ---

# ## **6) `fast = fast.next.next`**
# - Inside the loop, **move** `fast` **2 steps** forward.

# ### **Visual for Lines 3–6 (Finding the Middle)**

# Imagine a chain of nodes:

# ```
# head
#  ↓
# [1] → [2] → [3] → [4] → [5] → [6] → None
# ```

# - `slow` goes 1 node at a time.
# - `fast` goes 2 nodes at a time.

# Eventually, when `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be in the **middle**.

# ---

# ## **7) `second = slow.next`**

# - Once the loop ends, `slow` is pointing to the **middle** of the list.
# - `second` is set to **the node after** the middle. This marks the **start** of the second half.

# For example, if our list is `[1,2,3,4,5]`, and `slow` ended up on `3`, then `slow.next` is `4`.
# - So `second = [4]`.

# ---

# ## **8) `prev = slow.next = None`**

# - This might look weird, but it does two things at once:
#   1. `slow.next = None` → This **breaks** the list into two halves.
#      - First half ends at `slow`.
#      - So if `slow` was on `3`, now `3.next` is `None`.
#   2. `prev = None` → We also store `None` in a variable called `prev`.
#      - We'll use `prev` to help **reverse** the second half.

# ---

# ## **9) `while second:`**

# - Now we're going to **reverse** the second half of the list.
# - Keep looping as long as `second` is not `None`.

# ---

# ## **10) `tmp = second.next`**

# - **Temporarily** store the node after `second`.
# - Because we're about to mess with `second.next`, we don't want to lose the rest of the list.

# ---

# ## **11) `second.next = prev`**

# - We flip the pointer.
# - Instead of `second.next` pointing to the next node in the chain, we make it point **backwards** to `prev`.

# **This is how we build a reversed chain** one node at a time.

# ---

# ## **12) `prev = second`**

# - We move `prev` up to `second`.
# - So `prev` becomes the new head of the reversed list we're building.

# ---

# ## **13) `second = tmp`**

# - We move `second` forward to `tmp` (the next node in the original second half).
# - This continues until we've reversed all the nodes in the second half.

# ### **Visual for Lines 7–13 (Reversing the Second Half)**

# Imagine the second half is `[4] → [5] → [6] → None`. We do:

# 1. Grab `[4]`, point `[4].next` to `None` (reverse direction).
# 2. Then `[5]`, point `[5].next` to `[4]`.
# 3. Then `[6]`, point `[6].next` to `[5]`.
# 4. End result: `[6] → [5] → [4] → None`.

# ---

# ## **14) `first, second = head, prev`**

# - Now that the second half is reversed and pointed to by `prev`, we rename some pointers for clarity:
#   - `first` = `head` (start of the original list, the first half).
#   - `second` = `prev` (start of the **reversed** second half).

# So we have two lists:
# 1. **First half**: `[1] → [2] → [3] → None`
# 2. **Second half (reversed)**: `[6] → [5] → [4] → None`

# ---

# ## **15) `while second:`**

# - We'll **merge** the two halves in an alternating pattern: first from the first half, then from the second half, etc.
# - Keep going as long as `second` is not `None`.

# ---

# ## **16) `tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next`**

# - We store the next pointers in temporary variables so we don't lose track of anything.
# - `tmp1` is the node after `first`.
# - `tmp2` is the node after `second`.

# ---

# ## **17) `first.next = second`**

# - We make the first node's `next` point to the first node of the **reversed** second half.
# - This effectively "links" one from the first half to one from the second half.

# ---

# ## **18) `second.next = tmp1`**

# - We then link the second half node to the **next** node in the first half.
# - Now we've effectively connected:
#   - `[first] → [second] → [first.next]`

# ---

# ## **19) `first, second = tmp1, tmp2`**

# - Move both pointers (`first` and `second`) forward to continue merging.
# - `first` now points to `tmp1`, `second` now points to `tmp2`.
# - We keep merging until `second` is `None` (meaning we've exhausted the reversed half).

# ---

# # **Putting It All Together**

# 1. **Find the middle**:
#    - Use two pointers (`slow` & `fast`) to find the midpoint of the list.
# 2. **Reverse the second half**:
#    - Break the list into two halves, then reverse the second half.
# 3. **Merge them**:
#    - Alternate between nodes from the first half and the reversed second half.

# ---

# # **Simple Example & Visualization**

# Let's say our list is:
# ```
# 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
# ```

# ### **Step 1: Find the middle**
# - `slow` ends up on `3`.
# - `fast` ends up at the end (`5` or goes beyond).

# So we split it conceptually:
# - First half: `1 → 2 → 3`
# - Second half: `4 → 5`

# ### **Step 2: Reverse second half**
# - Reverse `4 → 5` to get `5 → 4`.
# - Now we have two halves:
#   - First: `1 → 2 → 3 → None`
#   - Second (reversed): `5 → 4 → None`

# ### **Step 3: Merge**
# - We weave them together:
#   - Take `1` from the first half, link to `5`.
#   - Then link `5` to `2`.
#   - Then `2` to `4`.
#   - Then `4` to `3`.
# - Final result:
#   ```
#   1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3
#   ```

# ---

# # **Analogy: "We're Braiding Two Ponytails"**

# 1. **Find the midpoint**: That's like splitting your hair into two sections.
# 2. **Reverse the second section**: You twist or flip the second section.
# 3. **Weave them together**: You take one strand from the first section, then one strand from the second section, and keep alternating.

# ---

# # **Done!**

# That's how the code works, line by line, in the simplest language possible. The key points are:

# - **Finding the middle** with `slow`/`fast`.
# - **Reversing** the second half in-place.
# - **Merging** the two halves by alternating nodes.
#
# I hope this step-by-step breakdown and visualization helps you see exactly what each line does and how the magic happens.
