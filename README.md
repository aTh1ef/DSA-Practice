# DSA-Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This project documents my journey as I tackle DSA problems daily, aiming to improve my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to solving various DSA problems using Python. It serves as both a record of my progress and a resource for others learning DSA. The focus is on practicing problems daily to build a strong foundation in fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Topics Covered

### Arrays

1. **Largest Element in an Array**
2. **Second Largest Element in an Array without Sorting**
3. **Check if the Array is Sorted**
4. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
5. **Left Rotate an Array by One Place**
6. **Left Rotate an Array by D Places**
7. **Move Zeros to End**
8. **Linear Search**
9. **Find Missing Number in an Array**
10. **Maximum Consecutive Ones**
11. **Find the Number that Appears Once, and Other Numbers Twice**
12. **Longest Subarray with Given Sum K (Positives)**

### Strings

1. **Remove Outermost Parentheses** 
2. **Reverse Words in a Given String / Palindrome Check** - Coming soon
3. **Largest Odd Number in a String**
4. **Longest Common Prefix** (Explanation Link: https://youtu.be/8C6F8_nM0qs?si=TyAH9sslD8rOzHdd)
5. **Isomorphic String** (Explanation Link: https://youtu.be/7yF-U1hLEqQ?si=lRDbeGGS2OwK9CWz )

## Goals

My primary objectives for this project are:

- Consistent practice of DSA problems
- Improving problem-solving skills
- Enhancing proficiency in Python programming
- Building a strong foundation in fundamental data structures and algorithms

## Future Plans

I intend to:

- Add more problems and solutions to this repository
- Cover a wider range of DSA topics and difficulty levels
- Provide regular updates with new content

## Contribution

While this is a personal practice repository, I welcome suggestions, improvements, and discussions.
