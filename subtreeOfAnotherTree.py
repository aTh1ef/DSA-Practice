#I'll explain how the code works step by step, in plain English. I'll even help you visualize it because you asked for it!

# ## üå≥ Problem Recap (Visualize It!)
#
# We have two trees:
# - **Big Tree** (called `root`): This is your main tree.
# - **Small Tree** (called `subRoot`): You want to check if this tree is hiding *inside* the big tree.
#
# Imagine the big tree is like a giant family tree üìú, and you are looking to see if one of the branches (subtrees) is an exact copy of the small tree.
#
# ---
#
# ## ‚úÖ Step 1: Understand What We're Doing
# We're trying to answer this question:
# > "Does the big tree `root` have a spot somewhere that looks exactly like the smaller tree `subRoot`?"
#
# And we do that by:
# 1. Walking through every node of the big tree (`root`).
# 2. At each node, asking:
#    **"Hey! Do you look like `subRoot`?"**
#    If yes, we're done. If not, we keep looking at the left and right children.
#
# ---
#
# ## üë®‚Äçüè´ Walkthrough the Code Line by Line
# (With comments and dumb-friendly explanation!)
#
# ---
#
# ```python
# # Definition for a binary tree node.
# # class TreeNode(object):
# #     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
# #         self.val = val
# #         self.left = left
# #         self.right = right
# ```
# ### What's happening here?
# ‚û°Ô∏è This is the basic structure of a tree node.
# Think of it as a little box üì¶ that:
# - Holds a value (`val`)
# - Has a left child (`left`)
# - Has a right child (`right`)
# A binary tree is just a bunch of these boxes linked together.
#
# ---
#
# ## üî® Now the real work begins...
# ```python
# class Solution(object):
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è This is just making a new class where we put our functions (methods).
#
# ---
#
# ### Function 1: `isSubtree`
# ```python
#     def isSubtree(self, root, subRoot):
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è We're making a function called `isSubtree`.
# Its job is to check if `subRoot` is somewhere inside `root`.
#
# ---
#
# ### Step 1: If subRoot is empty...
# ```python
#         # check if subRoot is empty (None). If it's empty, it's automatically a subtree!
#         if not subRoot:
#             return True
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è Picture this:
# If I ask you:
# > "Hey, is **nothing** (an empty tree) inside your big tree?"
# The answer is always "Yes!" ‚úÖ because *nothing* is always inside something.
#
# ---
# ### Step 2: If the big tree is empty...
# ```python
#         # if the big tree root is empty but subRoot isn't, subRoot can't be there!
#         if not root:
#             return False
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è If the big tree `root` doesn't exist (it's empty), and we're looking for a non-empty `subRoot`, it's impossible to find it.
# It's like saying:
# > "Can I find a tree inside an empty field?" üå≤‚ùå
# Nope. So return False.
#
# ---
#
# ### Step 3: Do these two trees look exactly the same **at this spot**?
# ```python
#         # check if the subtree starting from here is exactly the same as subRoot
#         if self.isSameTree(root, subRoot):
#             return True
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è We check:
# > "Does this node of the big tree look **exactly** like `subRoot`?"
# If yes, we found our match! üéâ Return True.
#
# ---
#
# ### Step 4: If no match here, check left and right children...
# ```python
#         # if not, check the left and right child nodes
#         result = self.isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) or self.isSubtree(root.right, subRoot)
#         return result
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è If this node doesn't match `subRoot`, we move down the tree:
# üëâ Check the left child
# üëâ Check the right child
# If either side has `subRoot`, we're happy and return True.
#
# ---
#
# ---
#
# ## üå≥ Function 2: `isSameTree`
# ‚û°Ô∏è This helper function checks if two trees are **exactly the same**.
#
# ---
#
# ### Function declaration
# ```python
#     def isSameTree(self, p, q):
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è `p` and `q` are two trees we want to compare.
#
# ---
#
# ### Step 1: Are both empty?
# ```python
#         # check if both p and q are None (empty). If they are, they are the same!
#         if not p and not q:
#             return True
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è If both trees are empty, they are obviously the same (both are nothing).
#
# ---
#
# ### Step 2: Is one of them empty or do they have different values?
# ```python
#         # if one is empty and the other isn't, or they have different values, they aren't the same
#         if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
#             return False
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è If one tree is empty and the other isn't‚Äîdifferent! ‚ùå
# If their values don't match‚Äîdifferent! ‚ùå
#
# ---
#
# ### Step 3: Compare their children (left and right)
# ```python
#         # check if their left subtrees and right subtrees are also the same
#         result = self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
#         return result
# ```
# ‚û°Ô∏è We dive deeper:
# üëâ Are their left children exactly the same?
# üëâ Are their right children exactly the same?
# If both are True, the trees are the same. ‚úÖ
#
# ---
#
# ---
#
# ## üß† Deep Visualization
# Let me paint a scene in your head:
#
# - Imagine `root` is a big family tree.
# - Imagine `subRoot` is a branch you cut out and you're trying to tape it back into the big tree, somewhere.
# - You start at the top of the big tree and work your way down.
# At each point, you ask:
# üëâ "Does this branch look *exactly* like the one I'm holding?"
# - If yes, cool, done!
# - If not, go down the left side and then the right side.
#
# The **`isSameTree()`** function is like taking a microscope üî¨ and comparing every leaf and twig on two branches to see if they're *exactly* the same.

#
# ## ‚úÖ Your Comments Feedback
#
# What you wrote:
# ```python
#     # check if the both the trees are empty. If botha are empty it means they are equal
# ```
# ‚úÖ Good! I'd maybe clean up the English just a bit for clarity:
# ‚û°Ô∏è "Check if both trees are empty. If they are, they are considered equal."
#
# What you wrote:
# ```python
#     # check if either p or q are empty and also check if the root values of p and q are equal
# ```
# ‚úÖ Nice! Could make it clearer:
# ‚û°Ô∏è "If one of them is empty or their values are not the same, they are not equal."
